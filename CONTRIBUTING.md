Please follow these coding conventions when writing code for inclusion in Scrapy:

- Unless otherwise specified, follow PEP 8.

- It’s OK to use lines longer than 79 chars if it improves the code 
  readability.

- Don’t put your name in the code you contribute; git provides enough 
metadata to identify author of the code. See https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/setting-your-username-in-git for setup instructions.

The guidelines for contributing are available here:
https://docs.scrapy.org/en/master/contributing.html

Please do not abuse the issue tracker for support questions.
If your issue topic can be rephrased to "How to ...?", please use the
support channels to get it answered: https://scrapy.org/community/
